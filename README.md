the class and find the product having the lowest price.
2. Read 2 matrices from the console and perform matrix addition.
3. Add complex numbers
4. Create CPU with attribute price. Create inner class Processor (no. of cores, manufacturer)
and static nested class RAM (memory, manufacturer). Create an object of CPU and print
information of Processor and RAM.

# Course Outcome 2 (CO2)

1. Program to Sort strings.
2. Perform string manipulations
3. Program to create a class for Employee having attributes eNo, eName eSalary. Read n
employ information and Search for an employee given eNo, using the concept of Array of
Objects.

# Course Outcome 3(CO3):

1. Area of different shapes using overloaded functions.
2. Create a class ‘Person’ with data members Name, Gender, Address, Age and a
constructor to initialize the data members and another class ‘Employee’ that inherits
the properties of class Person and also contains its own data members like Empid,
Company_name, Qualification, Salary and its own constructor. Create another class
‘Teacher’ that inherits the properties of class Employee and contains its own data
members like Subject, Department, Teacherid and contain constructors and methods
to display the data members. Use array of objects to display details of N teachers.

classes Circle and Rectangle which implements the above interface. Create a menu driven
program to find area and perimeter of objects.
